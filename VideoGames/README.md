# Video Games
In this workshop, students will explore the history of video games, and then create a retro-style game of their own. They will use Microsoft MakeCode Arcade, a web-based beginner-friendly code editor, to build a platformer game. They will be able to develop the gameplay, art assets, game map, and more. By the end of the workshop, they will have gained a basic understanding of game development, and each student will have a fully functioning arcade game of their own design.

### Agenda
Here are some general guidelines for the overall flow of the session:

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 15m |
| Presentation | 20m |
| Break | 10m |
| Code-Along | 45m |
| Game Sharing | 15m |
| Blooket | 15m |

### Tips
Here are some tips to ensure a successful run:

- Before the session, **read through this lesson plan thoroughly**
- During the session, ask the students questions as often as possible
    - Ask for their names, hobbies, animals, colors to use... anything!
    - Ask for suggestions about what to do next
    - Poll them to see what they know, or what they'd like to do
- Make sure to turn off notifications for Teams, Outlook, etc
- Make sure to zoom in properly on code blocks
- Encourage students to make their own choices in the project
    - The more they personalize their games, the more fun they tend to have!
- Take it slow at first, and always check to see how the students are progressing
    - Don't trust them to tell you; make sure to actually have an assistant look at their screens and give the go-ahead
    - Give students time to catch up before moving too far ahead, but...
    - Don't stall too long on any one part

## Session Outline
The entirety of the session flows through the [PowerPoint Presentation](RetroGames.pptx).

### Icebreaker
Have students draw a video game character using [Sketch Toy](https://sketchtoy.com/), and introduce themselves along with their drawings.

### Presentation
After students have warmed up with the icebreaker, it's time for the presentation portion of the [PowerPoint](RetroGames.pptx). These slides contain a brief history of video games (specifically focused on platformers), and there are talking points in the slide notes.

### Code-Along
Walk through the [Code-Along](CodeAlong.md) with the students. Start building a simple platformer using MakeCode Arcade.

#### Deviations
The students should be able to:

- Name their "Main Character" sprite something different
- Draw their own character, tile, and map
- Change the values for the controller `vx`, the gravity `ay`, the jump `vy`, the animation `interval`, and the `game over` effects

Other than those things, they should follow the instructor's code.

### Challenges
Give students some time to add more to their games. There are a bunch of challenges they can try by following the [guide](Challenges.md). The goal of this portion is to inspire the students to continue playing with MakeCode Arcade. The guide provides some direction for the students to add features to their game, but it is not necessary for the students to follow the challenge guidelines directly - encourage them to do whatever is most fun for them!!

### Blooket
[Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) is a fun formative assessment tool that's similar to Kahoot, but more game-based. There are a variety of game modes where the students compete against each other in different ways. Answering questions correctly helps them achieve more success in each game.

An account is required to host the game; here are some credentials you can use:

- Username: **techoutinst**
- Password: **Tech0utreach**

When setting up the game, consider how long it will take for the game to finish. Note that it will likely take 2-3 minutes for all the students to join the game, so a game time limit of **7 minutes** might end up taking about **10 minutes**.

1. Go to the [Blooket Login Page](https://id.blooket.com/login)
1. Enter the credentials above
1. Once logged into Blooket, go to the [question set](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/65084d4418adbc094405e876)
1. Click the **Host** button
1. Select the **Fishing Frenzy** game mode (or another requested mode), and click the **Host Game** button
1. Adjust the time as needed, and click the **Host Now** button
1. Instruct students to go to **play.blooket.com**, enter the Game ID and a nickname, and join the game
1. Once all students have joined, click the **Start** button

From there, the students will work on their own, answering questions and trying to win the game!


### Game Sharing
Encourage the students to share the games they've built with the room. They can share them through [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/YuXc5vhMQr).

## Conclusion
Make sure to close out the session on a strong, positive note of encouragement. Here are some key points to hit:

- Thank the students for participating
- Encourage them to continue learning about coding on their own
- Tell them they can reach us at **techoutreach@hyland.com** if they have any questions or would like any guidance
- Send them on their way!
