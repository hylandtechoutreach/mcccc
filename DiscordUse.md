# Discord Use
The club will use [Discord](https://discord.com/) as a way for students and instructors to communicate outside of the club meeting time.

[Click here to join the server!](https://discord.gg/WfMKEpBMWY)

## Parent/Guardian Consent Form Agreement 
As noted in the consent form that was signed by parents or guardians prior to participating in the club, each student has agreed to the following regarding the use of Discord: 

>I agree and understand that Hyland may provide for the use of certain unaffiliated third party websites or applications (“Third Party Sites”) in connection with the Program. I understand that use of these Third Party Sites is optional. If I choose to permit my child(ren) to use such Third Party Sites, I further understand and agree that: (i) the Third Party Site may collect personal information directly from my child(ren) subject to the terms and conditions (including an applicable privacy policy) available on the Third Party Site; and (ii) Hyland does not control these Third Party Sites and is not responsible for their information collection practices. 

## Additional Guidelines
- The usage of Discord is **not** required. If you do not want to use it, you will still be able to participate in the club.
- You must use your _real first and last name_ when communicating on Discord. If we see an account that does not have a real student name, the account will be kicked.
- If you say anything inappropriate, you will be banned from the server and may be removed from the club.
- Please be respectful of all students and instructors while communicating on Discord.
- Instructors will check Discord throughout the week during business hours, so feel free to post any time!
