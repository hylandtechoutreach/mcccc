# Building Websites with HTML & CSS
In this session, students will explore the inner workings of the World Wide Web, and then create websites of their own. They will use HTML to add text and pictures to their pages, and CSS to update fonts, colors, and more. By the end of the session, they will have gained a basic understanding of web development, and each student will have a totally unique website of their own design.

### Agenda
Here are some general guidelines for the overall flow of the camp:

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 30m |
| Presentation | 15m |
| Code-Along | 30m |
| Break | 10m |
| Customization | 10m |
| Sharing Sites | 10m |
| Blooket | 10m |
| Conclusion | 5m |

### Tips
Here are some tips to ensure a successful run:

- Before the session, **read through this lesson plan thoroughly**
- During the session, ask the students questions as often as possible
    - Ask for student's names, hobbies, movies they've seen, colors to use, fonts... anything!
    - Ask for suggestions about what to type next
    - Poll students to see what they know, or what they'd like to do
- Make sure to turn off notifications for Teams, Outlook, etc
- Make sure to zoom in properly on code or other smaller parts of the presenting screen
- Encourage students to make their own choices in the code
    - The more they personalize their websites, the more fun they tend to have!
- Take it slow at first, and always check to see how the students are progressing
    - Don't trust them to tell you; make sure to actually have an assistant look at their screens and give the go-ahead
    - Give students time to catch up before moving too far ahead, but...
    - Don't stall too long on any one part

## Session Outline
The entirety of the camp flows through the [PowerPoint Presentation](TheInternet.pptx).

### Icebreaker
Have students navigate [the old web](https://oldweb.today/?browser=ns4-mac#19960101/geocities.com/), and try to find interesting pages. If that site does not work, they can browse the [first ever website](https://info.cern.ch/).

### Presentation
After students have warmed up with the icebreaker, it's time for the presentation portion of the [PowerPoint](TheInternet.pptx). These slides contain a brief introduction to the world wide web and HTML/CSS, and there are talking points in the slide notes.

### Code-Along
The next few slides introduce the [code-along activity](CodeAlong.md). Start by briefly explaining [HyTop](https://hytop.onrender.com/) as an online platform for creating and sharing websites. It is totally free, and no accounts are required. It was developed by high school interns over the summer of 2025.

Next, have students open the [starter project](https://hytop.onrender.com/e/www) linked from the [session homepage](StudentDesc.md). Make sure they make a copy so they have their own version to edit.

From there, follow the [code-along instructions](CodeAlong.md) to show the students how to build their own websites!

### Customization
Give students some time to add more to their websites. There are a bunch of things they can try by following the [guide](Customization.md).

### Site Sharing
Encourage the students to share the websites they've built with the room. They can simply shout out their project names. Projects can be accessed at **hytop.onrender.com/pf/{PROJECT NAME}**. 

### Blooket: Formative Assessment
[Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) is a fun formative assessment tool that's similar to Kahoot, but more game-based. There are a variety of game modes where the students compete against each other in different ways. Answering questions correctly helps them achieve more success in each game.

>_For a Blooket guide with screenshots, [click here](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/coding-activities/blob/main/BuildingAWebsiteLessonPlan.md#formative-assessment-blooket)_

An account is required to host the game; here are some credentials you can use:

- Username: **techoutinst**
- Password: **Tech0utreach**

When setting up the game, try to time it so that it ends just a couple minutes before the camp ends. Note that it will likely take 2-3 minutes for all the students to join the game, so a game time limit of **7 minutes** might end up taking about **10 minutes**.

1. Go to the [Blooket Login Page](https://id.blooket.com/login)
1. Enter the credentials above
1. Once logged into Blooket, go to the [question set](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6426f2b7270eb96cab922257)
1. Click the **Host** button
1. Select the **Fishing Frenzy** game mode (or another requested mode), and click the **Host Game** button
1. Adjust the time as needed, and click the **Host Now** button
1. Instruct students to go to **play.blooket.com**, enter the Game ID and a nickname, and join the game
1. Once all students have joined, click the **Start** button

From there, the students will work on their own, answering questions and trying to win the game!

## Conclusion
Make sure to close out the session on a strong, positive note of encouragement. Here are some key points to hit:

- Thank the students for participating
- Encourage them to continue learning about coding on their own
- Tell them they can reach us at **techoutreach@hyland.com** if they have any questions or would like any guidance
- Send them on their way!
